My learning journey in cybersecurity has been a dynamic and evolving experience, driven by a passion for continuous growth and a commitment to excellence in the field. 
It began with my academic foundation at Lancaster University, where I graduated with first-class honours in Computer Networking and Security. 
This program equipped me with the technical and theoretical knowledge essential to understanding the complexities of cybersecurity, setting a strong foundation for my professional endeavors.

To validate my expertise and expand my professional horizon, I earned the ISC2 CISSP certification, 
a globally recognized credential in cybersecurity. This achievement highlighted my proficiency in critical areas such as risk management, security architecture, 
and governance, reinforcing my dedication to maintaining the highest standards of knowledge and practice in the industry.

Currently, I am pursuing a Masterâ€™s in Cybersecurity at Universiti Malaya. 
This program allows me to explore cutting-edge advancements, delve into research, and further refine my understanding of cybersecurity's ever-evolving landscape. 
It complements my professional experience, providing a solid academic grounding that enhances my ability to address emerging threats and craft innovative, data-driven security frameworks.

Professionally, my journey has been enriched through impactful roles in leading organizations. 
I spent four years as a Cyber Security Manager at United Overseas Bank Malaysia, where I developed and implemented robust security measures to protect critical assets in the fast-paced financial sector. 
In June 2024, I transitioned to my current role as an Assistant Manager in Group Information Security at AIA. Here, 
I continue to apply my expertise, focusing on safeguarding sensitive information, improving security strategies, and aligning technical solutions with organizational objectives.

My learning journey is fueled by a passion for exploring the unknown in cybersecurity. Every challenge presents an opportunity to grow,
innovate, and contribute to the field. With a blend of academic pursuits, professional experience, and a drive for lifelong learning,
I am committed to advancing cybersecurity practices and building a resilient, secure digital future.
