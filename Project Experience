Throughout my career, I have successfully led and executed critical cybersecurity projects that enhanced organizational security and compliance. 
At United Overseas Bank Malaysia, I spearheaded a project to block USB usage across the enterprise, 
ensuring data loss prevention and mitigating insider threats. 
This initiative extended to the removal of USB usage for servers, 
reinforcing the bank's secure infrastructure and adherence to regulatory standards.

Additionally, I took the lead in planning and executing the bankâ€™s annual penetration testing exercises. 
This involved coordinating with stakeholders, defining the scope, overseeing testing activities, 
and analyzing results to identify vulnerabilities. I also ensured that remediation measures were effectively implemented, 
strengthening the bank's security posture and resilience against potential cyber threats.

These projects reflect my ability to manage complex security initiatives, collaborate across teams, and deliver impactful solutions that align with organizational goals.
